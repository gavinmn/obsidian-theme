# Gavin's Obsidian Theme

Apply these snippets on top of the default Obsidian theme.

To use snippets, add the `.css` files to `yourvault/.obsidian/snippets/` and then go into the Obsidian Appearance preferences and toggle them on.

## Snippet functionality

### Accent colors

(These are snippets so they can be adjusted for light vs dark mode)

- `accent-blue.css` uses Apple's Blue accent colors
- `accent-yellow.css` uses Apple Notes' accent colors

The accent color snippets are mutually exclusive in use.

### UI cleanup

- `pickiness.css`, `cleanup.css` makes minor UI changes to reduce visual clutter. Note this does hide the file directory sort options because I don't use them. Delete lines 10â€“12 of `cleanup.css` to show them.

### Tabs

- `safaritabs.css` offers Safari style UI tabs on macOS
- `square-tabs.css` offers Figma style UI tabs on macOS

The tab snippets are mutually exclusive in use.

### Mobile

- `mobile.css` provides iPhone specific changes
- `ipad.css` provides iPad specific changes (these still need work...)
